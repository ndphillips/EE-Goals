# issue #2: Calculate, and plot, the probability of selecting the RSF best option at each trial
# ---------------------


# - Create a plot showing the proportion of participants that select the risk sensitive foraging
#   (RSF) best option on each trial.
# - Compare this to a plot showing the probability of selecting the high EV option
# 
# This could answer Rui's question: Are people more likely to select the RSF option as they 
# get closer to the goal?
